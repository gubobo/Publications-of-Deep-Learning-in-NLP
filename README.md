# Publications-of-Deep-Learning-in-NLP
This repo is to collect the publications and related resources of Deep Learning in NLP.

It is inspired by the great resource on [*CSE 599 - Advanced in NLP*](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/cse599.html).

I seperate the related works in several parts with the corrosponding Markdown files.

Feel free to pull request:)
